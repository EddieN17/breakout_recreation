# breakout_recreation

This is a Breakout recreation, written in Python 3.9 using Pygame.
I used 'Python Crash Course 2nd Edition' to learn the basic code to make this game.
It's possible that some parts of the code will need to be adapted to your screen resolution,
but most of the code should be universal for all screens.
Anyways, this is my first ever attempt at coding a functional game.
Hit 'escape' to exit the game.
